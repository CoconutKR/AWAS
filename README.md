## Ways to contribute
First, click on the "src" folder.

Next, select the folder for the airline you want.

Next, click on the desired aircraft type (e.g., A320).

Next, click on the specific aircraft type name (e.g., A319neo).

You'll now have a png file (e.g., A320neo.png).
With this file, you can now create an airline livery. Here's how I created an airline livery. (You don't have to do it this way, but this is a simpler method.)
First, I'll use the open-source image creation program "GIMP." (Please install the program.)
Second, you'll need the "ttd-newgrf-win.gpl - Gimp palette Windows file" from "https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=91568." (Download it here.)
Open the image in GIMP. Then, select Window (W) from the top menu and select Dockable Dialog (D).
This will add a palette list on the right. Drag the downloaded ttd-newgrf-win.gpl file to the palette list.
Double-click ttd-newgrf-win.gpl to display the palette.
Refer to "https://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/PalettesAndCoordinates" to see what role colors play.
Then, in this palette, After creating an airline livery using only color, select Image (I) from the GIMP menu, select Mode (M), and ensure it's set to Indexed (I). If not, select Indexed. Then, save and export the PNG file.
Once you've created the PNG file, please upload it here as an issue so I can add it through coding or modify the sprites to reflect the changes.
